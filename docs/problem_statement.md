# SIH26231 — Digital Companion for Field Drug Testing (Ministry of Home Affairs)

Official problem statement, saved verbatim. Check the build against this text.

---

Background:
Field drug-testing kits currently in use rely on visual interpretation of a
colour-change reaction. This makes results subjective, difficult to
standardise across officers, and leaves no verifiable record that a test was
actually conducted at a given place and time. As a result, field test outcomes
cannot presently be relied upon as documentary evidence.

Description:
Participants are to build a mobile application that works alongside existing
colorimetric field-test kits (no new hardware).
The application should:
* Capture an image of the test result using the device camera, using a
  reference colour card in-frame for lighting calibration.
* Automatically classify the result against a defined set of outcome
  categories (e.g., positive, negative, inconclusive).
* Generate a tamper-evident digital record of the test, capturing timestamp,
  GPS location, and an operator identifier, together with a cryptographic hash
  of the captured image.
* Maintain a simple, searchable log of tests conducted.

Expected Deliverables:
A working mobile/web application prototype demonstrating image capture,
automated result classification, and generation of a signed digital record.

Note to Participants:
The output of this application is a presumptive field-test result and a
supporting digital record; it does not replace laboratory confirmatory testing.
